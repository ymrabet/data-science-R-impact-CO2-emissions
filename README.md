Introduction:
Global warming has become a major problem. It endangers our health, national security and threatens other basic human needs. In fact, record high temperatures, rising seas, severe flooding, and droughtsâ€”are already increasingly common. This has become a global problem and one of our biggest concerns.
 
Testable hypothesis:
We believe that Norwegian car manufacturers make an impact on the total C02 emissions by introducing electric cars.

H0: The adaptation of manufacturers to sell electric cars has not led to an increased rate of change in the reduction of C02 emissions.

Ha: The adaptation of manufacturers to sell electric cars has led to an increased rate of change in the reduction of C02 emissions.
